# IIBA SDLC Workshop â€“ Support Ticket Management System

This project was developed as part of the **IIBA SDLC Workshop** to demonstrate how a support ticket management system can be modeled and implemented in a web-based prototype.  
It follows the full user journey: from login, to submitting a request, receiving confirmation, updating ticket status, and viewing reports on a dashboard.

2. **Design** â€“ Create structured wireframes and process flows.  
3. **Implementation** â€“ Build interactive web pages simulating the workflow.  
4. **Testing** â€“ Validate ticket submission, updating, and dashboard views.  
5. **Deployment** â€“ Host prototype for demonstration.  
6. **Maintenance** â€“ Enable continuous improvement and iteration.
